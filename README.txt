The ./SeqenticalModule.py is the implementation of the proposed sequential embedding module.
The ./data_generate.py contains the code to generate the three synthetic datasets used in this paper, and the ./datasets folder contains the pre-generated datasets.
Please use the Reproduce.ipynb to reproduce the result of the propossed sequential embedding module in Section 3.2.
